**Job**: PhD candidate in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago
**Hobby**: Theoretical and computational astrophysics

I explore the universe using whatever tools get the job done - numerical simulations, analytical theory, machine learning, and the occasional deep-dive into observational data.

My PhD thesis, advised by Prof. Nick Gnedin (who, according to himself, is also a movie director), focuses on cosmic reionization. I also spend time up in Madison, WI, working with Prof. Ellen Zweibel on all things cosmic rays.

When I’m not doing science, I’m usually busy building stuff or playing Go. You can find me somewhere between Chicago and Madison (on a Van Galder bus).
